#Infinite Scroll Proof of Concept

This project verifies the eligibility of infinite scrolling functionality in a single-page, AngularJS application. 

To begin:

`npm install`
`bower install`

To run the application on port 3000:

`npm start`

To open in Google Chrome with precise memory information, add this line to your .bash_profile:

`alias ogc='open -a Google\ Chrome --args --enable-precise-memory-info'`

Therefore, to run this application, for best results open on a fresh Google Chrome session, from the terminal, using this command: 

`ogc`
